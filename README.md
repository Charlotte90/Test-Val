# Test-Val
The mini framework I designed is  based on Page Object Module (POM). Although, I was no where near finished. I was able to set the structure on which my Test would have run.

All you need to do, is to open the Solution file in Visual Studio and run the Test Class in the TestArea.

Thank you.
